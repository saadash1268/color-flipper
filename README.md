# Color Flipper

This is a simple color flipper app created using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. The app generates a random hex color code and updates the background color of the body accordingly.

## Usage

1. Click on the "Click me" button.

## Functionality

The app utilizes the `Math.random()` function to generate a random number between 0 and 15. This random number is then used to index into an array of hexadecimal characters (0-9, A-F) to generate a random hex color code. The generated color code is then displayed in the span element with the class `.color` and applied to the background of the body element.

## Technologies Used

- HTML: The structure of the web page
- CSS: The styling of the web page
- JavaScript: The functionality of the app

## Installation

To run the app, you will need to download the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files and place them in the same directory. Once the files are in the same directory, you can open the HTML file in a web browser to view the app.
